### status

- Just trying to get to the end of the year with a little sanity intact. Working inside the systems without losing myself is much harder than the actual teaching.
- Went back to Korea in July 2025. Realized how much New Zealand doesn't agree with me.
- Korean language meetups stopped after the last venue closed confirming my suspicion that New Zealand can't support businesses. This means no regular physical meetups which is a bit depressing.
