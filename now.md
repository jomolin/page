### work

- Just trying to get to the end of the year with a little sanity intact. Working inside the systems without losing myself is much harder than the teaching.

### personal

- Went back to Korea in July. Realized how much New Zealand doesn't agree with me.
- Korean language meetups paused indefinitely because our venue shut down (...again. New Zealand seemingly can't sustain businesses).

### learning (on pause)

- Want to get back into math. Specifically linear algebra and calculus.
- Working my way through Harvard's cs50 course.
  - Current module: [week 4 - Memory](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2025/weeks/4/)

### reading

- Finished all of the [Dungeon Crawler Carl series](https://hardcover.app/@greatsandwiches/books/currently-reading)
- Starting Mistborn series
