title: a little room for me

This homepage is a little room where I can escape my daily life when it gets to be too much.

It's a hoarder pile of html templates and markdown files. It's built on the backs of others who put their work out there for free allowing a tired teacher to tinker as stress relief.

Sometimes I'll break it or make it look ugly, just like the the deep gash in my phone screen. But, that just makes it more mine.

There's nothing for sale, no like or share button. In fact I have no other social media. This is my only home online.

Stay as long as you like.
