## Personal Statement

Dedicated educator with over a decade of international teaching experience spanning diverse educational systems and cultural contexts. I believe in evidence-based, systematic instruction: explicit teaching, structured approaches, and high academic expectations for all students. My practice is built on the principle that every student can achieve when given clear, well-sequenced instruction, consistent feedback, and a well-managed learning environment. I am committed to using data to inform teaching decisions, differentiating instruction to meet diverse needs, and fostering environments where students develop both academic mastery and confidence as learners.
