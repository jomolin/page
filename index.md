## about

I like to make things, but I don't usually share them so publicly. Hopefully I can learn to work on things out in the open.

I like dates written year-month-day with leading zeroes. Weeks start on Sunday. My spelling is all mixed up since I left the US, but I still mostly prefer American spelling when I notice it.

This site is a home and a place for me to sort out my thoughts. It's my place online to relax and reflect on myself as a [meat computer](https://gravityfalls.fandom.com/wiki/We%27ll_Meet_Again). It's experimental and therapeutic, so don't take anything on here too seriously.

There's no monetization, advertisements, trackers, paywalls, or public comments. But, if you've got anything to add to my brain, feel free to [contact me](mailto:jsmolinelli@proton.me).

Just take off your shoes first before coming in.
